    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexities, meaning they run faster for larger inputs.
    </p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input size.
