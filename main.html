    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It helps in evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm. Understanding time complexity is crucial for optimizing code and ensuring that programs run efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates how the space requirement grows with the input size. Analyzing space complexity is important to ensure that algorithms do not consume excessive memory, which can lead to performance issues.
